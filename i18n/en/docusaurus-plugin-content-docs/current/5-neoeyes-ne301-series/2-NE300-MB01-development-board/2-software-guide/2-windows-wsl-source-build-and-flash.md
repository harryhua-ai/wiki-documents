title: Windows WSL Source Build And Flash
---

> Audience: users who build and flash NE301 from source in a Windows + WSL setup (via Docker) after following [Development Environment Setup](./development-environment-setup) and [System Flashing And Initialization](./system-flashing-and-initialization). Use this as a reference and adjust based on your hardware situation.

Key steps are shown below:

## 1. Environment Preparation
1. **Install/enable**
   - Windows 10/11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu recommended).
   - Docker Desktop, and in Settings → Resources → WSL Integration, enable your distro.
   - STLink driver: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com#get-software
   - STM32CubeProgrammer: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#get-software (handy for verifying the debugger and cable)
2. **Clone the repo (inside WSL)**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne301.git
   cd ne301
   ```
3. **Fix CRLF scripts**
   Some scripts turn into CRLF on Windows and error with `$'\r': command not found`. Convert them to LF in WSL:
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/\r$//' Script/generate-reloc-model.sh
   ```
4. **Confirm WSL can run Docker commands**: `docker version` should print client info.

## 2. Pass ST-LINK Through To WSL
1. In **elevated PowerShell**, install usbipd-win (skip if already installed):
   ```powershell
   winget install --exact dorssel.usbipd-win
   ```
2. Plug in ST-LINK and list devices:
   ```powershell
   usbipd list
   ```
   Note the ST-LINK `<busid>` (for example, maybe 2-3).
3. Force bind and enable auto-attach to all WSL2 distros:
   ```powershell
   usbipd bind --force --busid <busid>
   usbipd attach --wsl --auto-attach --busid <busid>
   ```

   <div style={{display:'flex', gap:'16px', flexWrap:'wrap', justifyContent:'center'}}>
     <img src="/img/ne301/windows-wsl-source/lsusb.png" alt="ST-LINK shown in lsusb" style={{width:'100%', maxWidth:'360px', borderRadius:'8px'}} />
     <img src="/img/ne301/windows-wsl-source/attach.png" alt="usbipd attach example" style={{width:'100%', maxWidth:'360px', borderRadius:'8px'}} />
   </div>

   - If prompted, reboot Windows and rerun the commands.
   - If attach fails, try `usbipd detach --busid <busid>`, `usbipd unbind --busid <busid>`, `wsl --shutdown`, replug ST-LINK, then bind/attach again.

   > Tip: If STM32CubeProgrammer is connected to the ST-LINK, disconnect it before passing through to WSL.

4. Back in WSL, verify:
   ```bash
   lsusb
   ```
   Seeing `0483:3748 STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2` means pass-through succeeded. If ST-LINK disappears after re-enumeration, repeat the PowerShell attach steps.

## 3. Start The Docker Dev Container
In the repo directory inside WSL (use `$(pwd)`; avoid `\` line breaks in PowerShell):
```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged \
  -v "$(pwd)":/workspace \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  camthink/ne301-dev:latest
```
> If you must run it in PowerShell, put it on one line or use the backtick ``` ` ``` for continuation. If the host lacks `/dev/bus/usb` you cannot pass USB; running inside WSL is still recommended.

After entering the container, confirm the toolchain and ST-LINK:
```bash
STM32_Programmer_CLI -l
```
If ST-LINK is not listed, re-check the usbipd attach status.

## 4. Build + Flash Flow
1. **Recommended one-liner** (inside the container):
   ```bash
   make flash
   ```
2. **Build only**:
   ```bash
   make          # FSBL + App + Web + Model
   make app      # same as single module build
   ```
3. **Flash components individually**:
   ```bash
   make flash-fsbl
   make flash-app
   make flash-web
   make flash-model
   make flash-wakecore
   ```

## 5. Common Issues & Fixes
### 5.1 Docker reports `invalid reference format`
PowerShell cannot use `\` for line continuation; use a single-line command or backtick ``` ` ```. Running inside WSL is recommended.

### 5.2 `$'\r': command not found`
Scripts were converted to CRLF. Run `sed -i 's/\r$//' <file>` or switch to LF in your editor.

### 5.3 `usbipd` attach fails / device disappears
- Run commands in **elevated PowerShell**.
- Replug the device, then `usbipd detach/unbind` → `wsl --shutdown` → `usbipd bind --force` → `usbipd attach --wsl --auto-attach`.

### 5.4 `Unable to get core ID / No STM32 target found`
- Usually a bad connection or the chip crashed: check SWDIO/SWCLK/GND/NRST wiring and common ground; verify DIP switches and power.
- Try low frequency + hard reset:
  ```bash
  STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=UR reset=HARD_RST freq=1000
  ```
  Press and hold Reset while running it if needed.

### 5.5 External Flash erase fails (optional)
1. Erase manually:
   ```bash
   STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=UR reset=HARD_RST freq=1000 \
     -e 0x70000000 0x70300000
   ```
2. Write again:
   ```bash
   STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=UR reset=HARD_RST freq=1000 \
     -d build/ne301_App_signed_pkg.bin 0x70100000 -v
   ```
3. If it still fails, check power/cables or try Mass Erase in the GUI with the External Loader.

### 5.6 `STM32_Programmer_CLI -l` shows no ST-LINK info

   Example:
   ```
   root@1e35ac8374ea:/workspace# STM32_Programmer_CLI -l
   Detected locale "C" with character encoding "ANSI_X3.4-1968", which is not UTF-8.
   Qt depends on a UTF-8 locale, and has switched to "C.UTF-8" instead.
   If this causes problems, reconfigure your locale. See the locale(1) manual
   for more information.

If the container cannot see any ST-LINK/serial devices, USB is not passed through or nothing is connected. Troubleshoot as follows:
- On the host/WSL, check devices: `lsusb` should show something like “STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2”. Install `sudo apt install usbutils` in WSL if `lsusb` is missing.
- In WSL, use `usbipd wsl list` to see status. If not attached, run `usbipd wsl attach --busid <busid>`, then confirm with `lsusb`.
- Container run args must include USB pass-through: `--privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb`. If the current container lacks USB, exit and re-run docker with these flags.
- Re-enter the container and run `lsusb`; once ST-LINK appears, `STM32_Programmer_CLI -l` should list it.
- Ensure the board is powered, cables are good, and no other program (e.g., VSCode debugger, STM32_Programmer Connect) is occupying the ST-LINK.

## 6. Tips For Getting The Device MAC

After flashing, reboot the device (Reset or power cycle) and connect to the WiFi AP named `NE301{MAC last 6 letters}`. If only one NE301 is nearby, just connect; for multiple devices, confirm the MAC:

- After it joins the LAN, find the MAC from your router/switch DHCP lease or ARP list. If you know the device IP, in Windows run:
  ```powershell
  ping <device IP>
  arp -a <device IP>
  ```
- Or check the label on the unit directly.
- Or watch the boot serial log (prints the device MAC).

After connecting a serial console, run `ifconfig wifi ap` to view the output.

## 7. Special Case

If the environment is set up and flashing succeeds but the device WiFi AP still will not start, the WiFi firmware may not be updated. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6TZb2Y8WKx) for further help.

## 8. Wrap-up

Using the WSL environment, the above steps let you reproduce the flows in [Development Environment Setup](./development-environment-setup) and [System Flashing And Initialization](./system-flashing-and-initialization) on Windows + WSL while avoiding common pitfalls. Cross-reference this with the original docs—hope it helps!
